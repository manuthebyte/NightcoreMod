# 🎶 NightcoreMod for Beat Saber

A simple yet powerful mod for Beat Saber that brings the **Nightcore** and **Daycore** experience right into the game!  
When enabled, this mod makes the pitch **go up** when a song is played faster — and **go down** when slower — just like you'd expect from classic pitch behavior.  
No more robotic pitch correction — just pure audio vibes ✨
