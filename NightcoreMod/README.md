# 🎶 NightcoreMod for Beat Saber

A simple yet powerful mod for Beat Saber that brings the **Nightcore** and **Daycore** experience right into the game!  
When enabled, this mod makes the pitch **go up** when a song is played faster — and **go down** when slower — just like you'd expect from classic pitch behavior.  
No more robotic pitch correction — just pure audio vibes ✨

## 🧩 Settings

You’ll find a new “Nightcore” tab in the **Mod Settings** panel.  
There, you can toggle:

- `Nightcore enabled`: When enabled and a song is set to "Faster", pitch goes up
- `Daycore enabled`: When enabled and a song is set to "Slower", pitch goes down
- `Preview Pitch`: Apply pitch changes to the menu preview audio as well

> Note: Preview Pitch functionality is currently toggleable, but actual pitch handling for previews is still under development.
